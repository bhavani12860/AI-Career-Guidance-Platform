## 📌 Overview
live link:https://ai-career-guidance-platform-1.onrender.com

**AI Career Guidance & Placement Platform** is a full-stack career-support web application designed to help students and job seekers understand their career direction, evaluate their skills, improve their resumes, prepare for interviews, discover relevant opportunities, and follow structured learning roadmaps.

## 📁 Frontend Structure

The UI is separated into dedicated stylesheets and JavaScript files for major application areas.

### CSS Modules

Examples include:

```text
career.css
dashboard.css
forgot_password.css
interview.css
jobs.css
learning.css
login.css
placement.css
profile.css
register.css
reset_password.css
resume.css
skill_gap.css
style.css
```

### JavaScript Modules

Examples include:

```text
career.js
dashboard.js
forgot_password.js
interview.js
jobs.js
learning.js
learning_notes.js
login.js
placement.js
profile.js
register.js
reset_password.js
resume.js
skill_gap.js
verify_otp.js
```

This separation keeps page-specific UI behavior maintainable and easier to extend.

---

## ⚙️ Local Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
cd AI-Career-Guidance-Platform
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

If the project contains a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise install the required packages used by the application and then generate the dependency file:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file locally.

Example:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
MYSQL_DB=ai_career_platform

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

ADZUNA_APP_ID=your_adzuna_app_id
ADZUNA_APP_KEY=your_adzuna_app_key

MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```

**Never commit `.env` to GitHub.**

### 5. Configure MySQL

Create the application database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ai_career_platform;
```

Then configure the database credentials through environment variables.

### 6. Run the Flask application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 🧪 Development Notes

For local development, Flask debug mode can be useful. For production deployment, use a production WSGI server and set:

```text
DEBUG=False
```

Sensitive configuration should be supplied through the hosting platform's environment-variable settings rather than hard-coded in Python files.

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

The application can be prepared for deployment on platforms such as:

- Render
- Railway
- PythonAnywhere
- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud
- Other platforms supporting Python/Flask

A typical deployment architecture is:

```text
GitHub Repository
       │
       ▼
Cloud Web Service
       │
       ├── Flask Application
       │
       ├── Environment Variables
       │
       └── Production WSGI Server
                │
                ▼
             MySQL
```

For production:

1. Configure environment variables.
2. Configure a cloud MySQL database.
3. Disable Flask debug mode.
4. Configure the Google OAuth redirect URI for the production domain.
5. Configure Gmail SMTP credentials securely.
6. Configure Gemini and Adzuna API credentials.
7. Use persistent storage or object storage for uploaded files.
